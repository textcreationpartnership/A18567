            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT REVEREND FATHER in Chriſt the L. Biſhop of WORCESTER, <hi>my</hi> very good Lord.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>y good Lord, it is nowe full two yeeres ſince vpon a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to reuiewe ſome part of thoſe exerciſes which I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the citie of Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, I extracted theſe fewe Sermons to ſerue for introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the rest. Vpon diſpatch whereof applying my ſelfe not long after to another matter of greater waight, and being thereby as by other occaſions hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from any conuenient leiſure to deale by my ſelfe for the publiſhing of theſe diſcourſes, they haue ſithence lien a ſleepe, till of late opportunitie ſeruing, I found the meanes to tender them to his hands which hath thus brought them into open light. Since which time being by your Lordſhip motioned to doe that which I had thus begunne to doe, and hauing your opinion that therein I ſhould do a ſeruice bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall and profitable to the Church, I was the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
<pb facs="tcp:15652:3"/>in that I had begunne, and preſumed the rather as before I had intented to commend vnto your Lordſhips good fauour the first fruites of theſe my reuiewed medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. And theerein I account your Lordſhip to haue ſome ſpeciall interest, both in regard of the place where they were performed being your owne Cathedrall Church, as alſo of my ſelfe; who hauing founde that Honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect at your Lordſhips handes ſince your first comming to that place, cannot but holde my ſelfe alwaies bound to yeeld a due acknowledgement and confeſsion thereof. Which I coulde not tell better how to doe then by a gift of inke and paper, which yet doth rather craue another fauour for the accepting of it, then yeelde any recompence of the former. But I hope this my labour ſhall not bee vnfruitefull vnto them who at the first were hearers of theſe Sermons. Who if they reaped any benefite or comfort at the first by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, may nowe renewe the ſame by reading, and more firmely imprint in minde what they then conceiued might ſerue for their edification and furtherance towardes God. And although I doubt not but if their regard in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring were anſwerable to my care in ſpeaking, they ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the taſte of thoſe wholeſome wordes that were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto them, yet to giue them the more full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect apprehenſion thereof, I will endeuour as opportunitie may ſerue to preſent vnto their eies the thinges which did once affect their eares, and to make others alſo partakers of the ſame. if at least theſe ſmall beginnings doe finde that comfortable entertainment both with them and others, as may giue encouragement to the rest to folowe after. Wherein I can promiſe to my ſelfe no more then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of theſe times will affoorde, in which their reigneth a nice and wanton humour which delighteth to bee tickled with the entiſing wordes of humane wiſedome, and more
<pb facs="tcp:15652:3"/>reſpecteth how finelie wee ſpeake to pleaſe the care, then how faithfully to touch the heart. But for my part as in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, ſo in writing, my care hath alwaies beene rather to edifie the conſcience of the godlie, then to feede the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the curious, and not to delude men with emptie wordes, but onelie by conuenient wordes to impreſſe and enforce the matter that I haue had in hand. And more then this the Reader may not expect either in this Treatiſe or anie other that heereafter happily may come from me. Which I know ſhall be pleaſing to your Lordſhip, whoſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels haue alwaies entirely tended to the ſauing of ſoules by implanting them with true faith and instructions of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie life, and by ſeeking paſsionately and effectually to enter into the harts of them to whom you haue ſpoken. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as God hath bleſſed your labours in other places, ſo I doubt not but hee will alſo in the place where nowe you are, as I hartilie wiſh and praie for, as willing to expreſſe mine affection to that citie wherein I haue bestowed the greateſt ſeruice of my life, and wherein I aſſure my ſelfe that a fewe names there are at least, I hope many that ſhall be my crowne and reioycing at the daie of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Of which ioy I enuie not that any man ſhould be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker with me, but rather deſire to heare of a ſucceſſour in my place, by whoſe good meanes they may be yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increaſed and ſtabliſhed in the grace of God. Which how neceſſarie a care it is, I thinke there is no man but ſeeth, that inwardly waigheth and taketh to hart the ſtate of our daies wherein we are ſo ſetled vpon the lees of thoſe corruptions which are vſually bredde by long proſperitie and peace, as that much worke it is, not onely to waken them that are aſleeepe, but alſo to keepe men from ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, when they are once awake. The due conſideration whereof if it were admitted woulde perhaps ſtirre vp the
<pb facs="tcp:15652:4"/>deuotion of them whom it concerneth to be mindefull of their owne good. Which I knowe manie of them are, and God I hope by your Lordſhips good meanes will mooue the rest. With which hope I recommend theſe remembrances to your Lordſhips fauourable acceptation, beſeeching God ſo to bleſſe your endeuours and courſes as that they may yeeld glorie vnto God, and profite to his church, and comfort to your owne ſoule at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Ieſus Christ.

The world did ſtriue againſt it, and it ouercame the world: the Scepters of Princes ſtrooke at it to beate it downe, and Princes ſcepters gaue it way whether they would or not. They bound the preachers of it, but it ſelfe was as the winde which cannot be bound nor ſtayed from his courſe.

And to this purpoſe hee nameth an armour or attire which

For whatſoeuer the perſon be, yet if he offer not vnto God that that is woorthy of God, his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is not admitted, neither can he thereby purchaſe remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and forgiueneſſe of ſinnes. Thirdly on the excellency of his perſon, and worthineſſe of his ſacrifice dependeth the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and acceptation of his praier. For he cannot by praier pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelfe vnto God as an interceſſour and mediatour for vs, who himſelfe ſtandeth ſubiect to chalenge either for the vnworthineſſe of his perſon, or for the baſeneſſe of his offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. But he that anſwereth both theſe conditions, his praier is of force to obtaine grace and mercy for them that commit themſelues vnto him. They that teach any prieſthood truely, and in it ſelfe effectuall and auaileable for the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, in which theſe three conditions are not ſatisfied, they teach not the truth of God but their owne deuiſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by deceiue both themſelues and other men.</p>

Thus children tread in their fathers ſteps, and ſucceſſours follow the cruelties and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly courſes of their predeceſſours, without any doubt or feare at all of their vnexpected and fearefull end. Although therefore that God doe thus ſet foorth his iudgement by many dreadfull examples euen in this life, yet it is to the moſt as if he iudged not, becauſe men will not take it to be his iudgement.

But <hi>that day of iudgement</hi> ſhall reforme all this errour, when as they that now refuſe to ſee or to acknowledge the power and worke of God in thoſe executions which hee performeth in this world, ſhall haue their eies opened to ſee it whether they will or not, and it ſhall come to paſſe which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith:<note n="c" place="margin">

Certeine it is that iuſt vengeance is ſtill waiting at the heeles of the enemies of Chriſt, and ceaſeth not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them vntill it haue vtterly deſtroied them. They may ſeeme for a time to flie and to eſcape; their pompe and power may ſeeme to hide them and to ſhield them from the Lords hand; but in the end he will ouertake them, and find them out, and pull them out of their holes, and ſet his feete vpon their necks; and poure vpon them euerlaſting confuſion. Let no man flatter himſelfe; let no man be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in enmitie againſt the Lord. Preſent ſtanding is no warrant againſt future falling.

As holding downe the head betokeneth ſorow and ſhame, ſo the holding or lifting vp of the head betokeneth reioycing, and triumph, and glorie, and full confidence of ſafetie and aſſured eſtate. Thus ſhall Chriſt lift vp the head by way of triumphing and reioycing, when he ſhall haue taken full vengeance of his aduerſaries, and freed, not himſelfe onely, but the whole body of his church from the aſſaults and dangers of all enimies. We ſee now that oftentimes, though not in himſelfe, yet in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, he is faine to hang downe the head, and to weare the badges of reproch and ſhame, whileſt the vngodly vaunt themſelues, and goe<note n="c" place="margin">
